I had a blast at the Nebula freshers party last night. It was my first time attending such an event and I was amazed by the decorations, the music, and the atmosphere. The theme was space and everyone was dressed in futuristic outfits. There were stars, planets, and rockets hanging from the ceiling and the walls were covered with glowing lights. The DJ played some awesome tunes that made me want to dance all night. I met some new friends and we had fun chatting, laughing, and taking selfies. We also enjoyed some delicious snacks and drinks that were served by the organizers. The highlight of the night was the surprise performance by a famous singer who sang some of his hit songs. Everyone cheered and sang along with him. It was a memorable night that I will never forget. I am so glad I went to the Nebula freshers party and I canâ€™t wait for the next one.
